	4. Authentication System (Clerk)
4.1 Authentication Flow
1. Users sign up/sign in via Clerk's authentication interface
2. Upon successful authentication, Clerk issues a JWT token
3. Frontend stores the token and includes it in the Authorization header for API requests
4. Backend validates the token using Clerk's SDK
5. User sessions are managed by Clerk with configurable session duration
4.2 Clerk Integration Implementation
# Backend FastAPI integration
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI, HTTPException, status
from clerk_sdk_python import ClerkClient
from clerk_sdk_python.errors import ClerkError


app = FastAPI()
clerk_client = ClerkClient()


async def get_current_user(authorization: str = Header(...)):
    try:
        token = authorization.replace("Bearer ", "")
        # Verify the token and get user information
        user = clerk_client.verify_token(token)
        return user
    except ClerkError:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
            headers={"WWW-Authenticate": "Bearer"},
        )


@app.get("/protected-route")
async def protected_route(user=Depends(get_current_user)):
    return {"message": f"Hello, {user.first_name}"}


// Frontend React integration
import { ClerkProvider, SignIn, SignUp, useUser } from '@clerk/clerk-react';


const clerkPubKey = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY;

      <Router>
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/sign-in/*" element={<SignIn routing="path" path="/sign-in" />} />
          <Route path="/sign-up/*" element={<SignUp routing="path" path="/sign-up" />} />
          <Route
            path="/dashboard"
            element={

                <Dashboard />
              </ProtectedRoute>
            }
          />
        </Routes>
      </Router>
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}

    return <Navigate to="/sign-in" />;
  }
  
  return children;
}
